# Keeping Mantises

## Overview

Keeping Mantises is a website dedicated to the care of raising pet mantises.

## Background

This is a project used to develop my skills with React. For my web-design class, I had designed this website with PHP,
JavaScript, SQL, CSS, and HTML. Much of the work I had previously done on that website was lost, which is a shame, but
a good opportunity for me to use the same project to develop my skills with React.

Some additional notes I thought worth mentioning:
 * IntelliJ did not create most of the folders and files as needed. As such, I needed to create the src directory and
   then the components directory inside of it. I then had to create the App.js file in the src folder.
 * IntelliJ also did not create package.json, so running npm install caused errors. I had to create the file manually,
   and used ChatGPT's recommendation for doing so. I also modified the name from keeping-mantises-react to
   keeping-mantises, but I don't think that should cause issues.
 * Components are the building blocks of modular programming in React, and are analogous to classes and objects.
 * App.js is kinda/sorta similar to the driver class in that it is the starting point of the program.

## Usage

The following are the requirements to run this project:

 * Node Package Manager (NPM)
 * React

 To run this project, download the repository and input the following command into the terminal:
  $ npm start

  *Note*: I am basing this information on the following website since I have not made a React readme before, so I am
  uncertain of the correctness of this.
